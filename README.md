This repository contains different scripts and utilities for analyzing the physical memory usage of an application and its cache-performance.
The python scripts present in the 'analysis_scripts' directory contain python code for skimming through the physical page frame numbers that
an application used in its life-cycle and the collective mapping of those pages to cache-slices.
The utility present in the 'cache_flush' folder can be used for flushing the content of the last-level cache in its entirety.
